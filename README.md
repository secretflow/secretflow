SecretFlow is a unified framework for privacy-preserving data intelligence and machine learning. To achieve this goal,
it provides:

- An abstract device layer consists of plain devices and secret devices which encapsulate various cryptographic protocols.
- A device flow layer modeling higher algorithms as device object flow and DAG.
- An algorithm layer to do data analysis and machine learning with horizontal or vertical partitioned data.
- A workflow layer that seamlessly integrates data processing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.
