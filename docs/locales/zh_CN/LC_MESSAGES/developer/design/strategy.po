"The federated learning strategy is the key difference between federated "
"learning and conventional distributed machine learning, and it is "
"critical to the effect of model training. Strategy is mainly composed of "
"two parts in federated learning. One part is the local training strategy "
"of the local part, which includes the control of the loss function (how "
"to align the server side, etc.), how to transmit gradients or parameters "
"upstream; the second part is the server part, It includes how to "
"aggregate gradients or parameters uploaded by Clients, how to update "
"them, and how to distribute them downstream. SecretFlow encapsulates a "
"layer of Strategy under FLModel to control the learning strategy of the "
"model in federated scenarios. The lingo provides Strategy Zoo, which "
"currently supports various strategies covering Non-iid and communication "
"optimization, and is constantly updated iteratively. Users Just pass the "
"alias names of different strategies (\"fed_avg_w\", \"fed_avg_g\", "
"\"fed_prox\", \"fed_scr\", etc.) to complete the call. At the same time, "
"the Strategy framework supports the development, registration, and use of"
" user-defined strategies."
msgstr "联邦学习策略是联邦学习区别于常规分布式机器学习的关键差别，对于模型训练效果影响非常关键。Strategy在联邦学习中主要由两部分组成，一部分是local部分的本地训练策略，其中包含对于loss函数的控制（和server端如何对齐等），梯度或者参数怎么上行传输；第二部分是server部分，包含如何对Clients上传的梯度或参数如何聚合，如何更新，如何下行分发等。"
"SecretFlow在FLModel之下封装了一层Strategy，控制模型在联邦场景下的学习策略，隐语提供了Strategy Zoo，目前已支持涵盖Non-iid和通信优化等多种策略，而且在不断的迭代更新，用户只需要传递不同策略的alias name("fed_avg_w","fed_avg_g","fed_prox","fed_scr"等)，即可完成调用。同时Strategy框架支持用户自定义策略开发、注册、使用等。"
