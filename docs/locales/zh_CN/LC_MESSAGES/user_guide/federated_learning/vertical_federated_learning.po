"The core idea of split learning is to split the network structure. Each "
"device (silo) retains only a part of the network structure, and the sub-"
"network structure of all devices is combined together to form a complete "
"network model. In the training process, different devices (silo) only "
"perform forward or reverse calculation on the local network structure, "
"and transfer the calculation results to the next device. Multiple devices"
" complete the training through joint model until convergence."
msgstr "拆分学习的核心思想是拆分网络结构。每一个参与方拥有模型结构的一部分，所有参与方的模型合在一起形成一个完整的模型。训练过程中，不同参与方只对本地模型进行正向或者反向传播计算，并将计算结果传递给下一个参与方。多个参与方通过联合模型进行训练直至最终收敛。"
