Federated NN Model
===================

You could define a federated learning NN model with Tensorflow or PyTorch easily.

Please check API of :py:class:`~secretflow_fl.ml.nn.FLModel`.

You may also check tutorials:

- :doc:`/tutorial/Federate_Learning_for_Image_Classification` This is an example to demonstrate defining a model with TensorFlow.
- :doc:`/tutorial/Federated_Learning_with_Pytorch_backend` This is an example to demonstrate defining a model with PyTorch.

If you are interested, we also encourage you to check :doc:`/developer/design/flmodel`.
