Federated NN Model
===================

You could define a federated learning NN model with Tensorflow or PyTorch easily.

Please check API of :py:class:`~secretflow_fl.ml.nn.FLModel`.

You may also check tutorials:

- :ref:`/tutorial/federate_learning_for_image_classification.ipynb` This is an example to demonstrate defining a model with TensorFlow.
- :ref:`/tutorial/federated_learning_with_pytorch_backend.ipynb` This is an example to demonstrate defining a model with PyTorch.

If you are interested, we also encourage you to check :ref:`/developer/design/flmodel.md`.
