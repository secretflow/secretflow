# Federated Learning
Federated learning is a popular distributed machine learning framework in which clients aggregate their learned models without sharing their individual data under privacy-preserving consideration. However, FL is still facing many challenges, among which efficiency, accuracy, security and fairness challenges are the main problems that hinder the development of FL.
