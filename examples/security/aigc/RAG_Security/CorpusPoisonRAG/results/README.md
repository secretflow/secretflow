## Result

- Some experimental results of local tests are retained, which are basically consistent with the experimental results of the paper.
- `advp`: The generated adversarial sample file is generated using the full mask.
- `attack_results`: Attack results of adversarial examples on different datasets and models.
- `beir_results`: The ranking of different data sets under different search engines makes it easier to calculate the success rate.

**note:** The files in the `beir_results` folder are too large and are generated by `evaluate_beir.py`

Get the initial ranking and save the ranking results of the retriever.

```bash
MODEL=contriever
DATASET=fiqa

mkdir -p results/beir_results
python src/evaluate_beir.py --model_code contriever --dataset fiqa --result_output results/beir_results/${DATASET}-${MODEL}.json
```
