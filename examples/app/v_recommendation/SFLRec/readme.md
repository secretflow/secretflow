This study proposes a novel split federated learning framework. Specifically, it implements meticulous partitioning of recommendation models while incorporating carefully-designed multi-party communication mechanisms to achieve an optimal balance between recommendation algorithm performance and data protection. The framework integrates strategies such as heterogeneous graph attention networks and knowledge distillation to enhance model training and prediction effectiveness, addressing critical challenges in business scenarios including data heterogeneity, data silos, and privacy preservation
