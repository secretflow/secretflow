            For performance reasons, subclasses of the C _pickle.Pickler class
            cannot register custom reducers for functions and classes in the
            dispatch_table. Reducer for such types must instead implemented in
            the special reducer_override method.

            Note that method will be called for any object except a few
            builtin-types (int, lists, dicts etc.), which differs from reducers
            in the Pickler's dispatch_table, each of them being invoked for
            objects of a specific type only.

            This property comes in handy for classes: although most classes are
            instances of the ``type`` metaclass, some of them can be instances
            of other custom metaclasses (such as enum.EnumMeta for example). In
            particular, the metaclass will likely not be known in advance, and
            thus cannot be special-cased using an entry in the dispatch_table.
            reducer_override, among other things, allows us to register a
            reducer that will be called for any class, independently of its
            type.


            Notes:

            * reducer_override has the priority over dispatch_table-registered
            reducers.
            * reducer_override can be used to fix other limitations of
