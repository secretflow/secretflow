    R2 Score (r2_score): It is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates a better fit.

    Mean Absolute Error (mean_abs_err): It calculates the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. It provides a measure of the average magnitude of the errors.

    Mean Absolute Percentage Error (mean_abs_percent_err): It calculates the average absolute percentage difference between the predicted and actual values. It measures the average magnitude of the errors in terms of percentages.

    Sum of Squared Errors (sum_squared_errors): It calculates the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. It provides an overall measure of the model's performance.

    Mean Squared Error (mean_squared_errors): It calculates the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. It is widely used as a loss function in regression problems.

    Root Mean Squared Error (root_mean_squared_errors): It is the square root of the mean squared error. It provides a measure of the average magnitude of the errors in the original scale of the target variable.

    Mean of True Values (y_true_mean): It calculates the average of the actual values in the target variable. It can be useful for establishing a baseline for the model's performance.

    Mean of Predicted Values (y_pred_mean): It calculates the average of the predicted values. It can be compared with the y_true_mean to get an idea of the model's bias."""
